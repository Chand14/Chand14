### &#x1F4A1; What I'm interested in

- **AI-assisted development** &mdash; coding agents, prompt-driven workflows, and what it means for non-traditional developers
- **Platform engineering** &mdash; building internal platforms that make other teams faster
- **Developer experience** &mdash; reducing friction, improving visibility, making the right thing the easy thing
- **Systems thinking** &mdash; applying systems engineering principles to software organizations

---

### &#x1F331; Currently building

- An internal **metrics dashboard** that gives engineering leadership clear insight into platform costs, usage, and trends across all our capabilities
- This GitHub profile &mdash; with the help of AI, naturally
