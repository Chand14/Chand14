### Background

I come from systems engineering, not computer science. My career has been spent designing, integrating, and improving complex technical systems. That perspective now shapes how I think about developer platforms, infrastructure, and the tools that help engineering teams do their best work.

I'm relatively new to programming. I'm learning by doing, and I'm genuinely excited about what AI-assisted development makes possible for people like me.

### What I'm working on

- **Core Engineering at IKEA** &mdash; internal developer platform serving 1,800+ developers. Our team manages capabilities across GitHub, JFrog Artifactory, HashiCorp Vault, cloud infrastructure, and developer tooling.

- **AI-assisted development** &mdash; exploring what it means to build software with AI coding agents. I use [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and its GSD workflow to go from idea to working code. Some call it vibecoding. I call it the future of how non-traditional developers contribute to software.

- **Dashboards and visibility** &mdash; building tools that give engineering leadership clear insight into platform costs, usage, and trends across our capabilities.

### Interests

- AI-assisted development and coding agents
- Platform engineering and developer experience
- Making engineering organizations more effective
- The intersection of systems thinking and software

### About this profile

Most of the repositories here are things I've built while learning. They reflect a journey, not a destination. I believe the best way to understand something is to build with it, and that's what I'm doing.
